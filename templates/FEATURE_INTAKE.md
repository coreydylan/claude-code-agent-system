# Feature Intake System

*Managed by: feature-intake-agent*

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Submit Feature Requests

### Via Claude Code Agent
```
"I need to request a new feature: [describe your feature]"
# The feature-intake-agent will automatically process your request
```

### Via Direct Request
Use the following format for feature requests:

**Title**: Brief, descriptive name  
**Description**: Detailed explanation of the feature  
**Business Justification**: Why this feature is needed  
**User Story**: As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]  
**Priority**: Low/Medium/High/Critical  
**Estimated Users Impacted**: Number or percentage  
**Deadline**: Any business deadlines (optional)  

## ðŸ“‹ Intake Process

The feature-intake-agent follows this process:

### 1. **Initial Validation**
- âœ… Complete information provided
- âœ… No duplicate requests  
- âœ… Aligns with product vision
- âœ… Technically feasible (preliminary assessment)

### 2. **Effort Estimation**  
- Small (< 1 day): Auto-approved for next sprint
- Medium (1-5 days): Requires roadmap review
- Large (> 1 week): Requires stakeholder approval
- Epic (> 1 month): Requires architectural review

### 3. **Queue Routing**
- **Urgent**: Critical bugs, security issues, production down
- **Feature-dev**: New features, enhancements  
- **Maintenance**: Bug fixes, tech debt, optimizations
- **Research**: Investigations, proof of concepts

### 4. **Stakeholder Notification**
- Requester gets confirmation with tracking ID
- Admin gets summary for high-priority requests
- Roadmap updated if accepted
