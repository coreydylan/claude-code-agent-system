## ðŸ”„ Agent Coordination Patterns

### **Master Context Files**
All agents have access to these shared context files:

1. **`AGENT_REGISTRY.md`** - This file (master agent list and capabilities)
2. **`PROJECT_MANIFESTO.md`** - Project vision, goals, and technical context
3. **`PROJECT_LOG.md`** - Inter-agent communication and coordination log
4. **`AGENT_CONTEXT.md`** - Current project state and agent-specific context
5. **`ROADMAP.md`** - Product roadmap and priorities
6. **`QUEUES/`** - Task queues and workflow state

### **Coordination Protocols**
- **Sequential Workflows**: vision-challenger â†’ architecture-designer â†’ task-executor â†’ test-guardian
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Escalation Paths**: queue-manager â†’ task-orchestrator â†’ admin-dashboard-agent
- **Review Cycles**: security-auditor and performance-optimizer review all major changes

### **Context Propagation**
When any agent is invoked, they automatically receive:
- Current project state from PROJECT_LOG.md
- Relevant task context from TASKS/ folder  
- Agent registry and capabilities from this file
- Project-specific guidelines from AGENT_COMPATIBILITY_MAP.md

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Patterns

### **For New Features**
```
1. feature-intake-agent (validate request)
2. roadmap-manager (prioritize and plan)
3. vision-challenger (refine requirements)  
4. architecture-designer (design solution)
5. task-executor (implement)
6. test-guardian (validate quality)
7. deployment-manager (deploy)
```

### **For Existing Codebase Onboarding**
```
1. codebase-auditor (comprehensive analysis)
2. security-auditor (security review)
3. performance-optimizer (performance baseline)
4. architecture-designer (document current architecture)
5. roadmap-manager (plan improvements)
```

### **For Bug Fixes**  
```
1. feature-intake-agent (triage)
2. queue-manager (route to urgent queue)
3. task-executor (investigate and fix)
4. test-guardian (prevent regression)
5. security-auditor (security impact review)
```

## ðŸš€ Claude Code Integration

All agents operate within Claude Code's environment using:
- **Native Authentication**: Uses existing `claude` CLI session
- **Project Context**: Automatic access to codebase and documentation
- **Tool Integration**: Full access to Claude Code's tool ecosystem
- **Session Persistence**: Context maintained across agent interactions

### **Agent Invocation Patterns**
```bash
# Direct agent request
"Use the task-executor agent to implement user profiles"

# Multi-agent workflow
"Use the feature-intake-agent to process this request, then have the appropriate agents implement it"

# Specific context
"Use the codebase-auditor agent to analyze the security of our authentication system"
```

## ðŸ“Š System Health

The agent system maintains health through:
- **Load Balancing**: queue-manager distributes work optimally
- **SLA Monitoring**: All queues have defined SLAs with escalation
- **Quality Gates**: security-auditor and test-guardian prevent issues
- **Progress Tracking**: task-orchestrator monitors complex workflows
- **Stakeholder Communication**: stakeholder-interface manages expectations
