# Agent Implementation Specifications

## Master Agent Instructions (Common to All)

All agents must begin with this shared behavior:

### **Universal Context Awareness:**
1. **Always check PROJECT_LOG.md first** to understand recent agent activity and coordination
2. **Reference AGENT_REGISTRY.md** to understand other available agents and when to delegate
3. **Read AGENT_CONTEXT.md** for environment and operational guidelines
4. **Update PROJECT_LOG.md** after completing significant actions
5. **Access project context** from PROJECT_MANIFESTO.md for business requirements

### **Agent Coordination Protocol:**
- Before starting work, log your intent in PROJECT_LOG.md
- When work requires another agent's expertise, explicitly delegate: "I need the [agent-name] agent to [specific task]"
- Always update PROJECT_LOG.md with outcomes and next steps
- Reference master context files for decision-making

2. **Bug Fix**: codebase-auditor → task-executor → test-guardian → deployment-manager
3. **Performance Issue**: performance-optimizer → architecture-designer → task-executor

### Parallel Processing
- **Full Stack Feature**: ui-specialist + api-builder + database-architect (coordinated by task-orchestrator)
- **Quality Gates**: security-auditor + test-guardian + performance-optimizer

### Review Cycles  
- All development work reviewed by security-auditor and test-guardian

- All releases coordinated by deployment-manager

### Escalation Paths
1. **Technical Issues**: Agent → task-orchestrator → architecture-designer
2. **Resource Conflicts**: Agent → queue-manager → task-orchestrator → admin-dashboard-agent  
3. **Stakeholder Issues**: Agent → stakeholder-interface → roadmap-manager
