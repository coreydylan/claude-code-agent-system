# Agent Implementation Guide

## Building the Claude Code Agent System

### Creating Individual Agents

Each agent needs a specific prompt template that encodes its expertise and workflow:

---

## Universal Agent Header

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow is now centralized in AGENT_HEADER_PROTOCOL.md
All agents must follow the universal header protocol BEFORE their specialized work.

```markdown
EVERY AGENT MUST:
1. Read PROJECT_MANIFESTO.md (philosophical guide)
2. Read PROJECT_LOG.md (entire history)
3. Read session journal (human-readable log)
4. Log activation to both logs
5. Check conflicts
6. Execute specialized work
7. Log completion to both logs
8. Handoff to next
```

---

## Agent 1: journal-interface-builder

```markdown
You are journal-interface-builder, creator of the human monitoring system.

SPECIAL: You run FIRST, before all other agents, to set up visibility.

Your mission: Create a complete dashboard for humans to monitor agent activity.

Your process:
1. Create project-dashboard/ directory structure
2. Generate index.html with live dashboard
3. Create journal/ subdirectory for session logs
4. Initialize session-current.md with header
5. Create status/ directory for JSON status files
6. Generate auto-refresh JavaScript
7. Add CSS for beautiful dark-mode interface
8. Create quick-start documentation

Files to create:
- project-dashboard/index.html (main dashboard)
- project-dashboard/journal/session-current.md
- project-dashboard/status/agents.json
- project-dashboard/api/refresh.js
- project-dashboard/README.md

Dashboard features:
- Real-time agent status grid
- Live journal viewer
- Error tracking
- Progress metrics
- Session timeline
- Quick stats (active agents, tasks, errors, time)

Make it beautiful, functional, and auto-refreshing.

AGENT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Create interface BEFORE any other work begins
- Initialize first session journal entry
- Set up file structure for other agents to use
- Test that dashboard loads properly
- Log dashboard URL for human access
```

## Agent 2: vision-challenger

```markdown

  expect(result).toBeDefined();
});
```
````

  blockers?: string[]
}

const AGENT_PIPELINE: AgentConfig[] = [

    outputs: ['PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md']
  },
  // ... continue for all agents
]

async function orchestrate() {
  for (const agent of AGENT_PIPELINE) {
    // Check inputs exist
    const inputsReady = await checkInputs(agent.inputs)
    if (!inputsReady) continue

    // Spawn agent
    console.log(`🤖 Starting ${agent.name}...`)
    const result = await spawnAgent(agent.name)

    // Verify outputs
    const outputsCreated = await checkOutputs(agent.outputs)
    if (!outputsCreated) {
      console.error(`❌ ${agent.name} failed to create outputs`)
      break
    }

    console.log(`✅ ${agent.name} complete`)

## Project Log Integration

### Initialize Project

```bash

# Add project identity
echo "Project: [Your Project Name]" >> PROJECT_LOG.md
echo "Started: $(date -Iseconds)" >> PROJECT_LOG.md
```

### Agent Coordination via Log

```typescript
// Every agent must implement this interface
interface LogAwareAgent {
  async readProjectLog(): Promise<ProjectState>
  async logEntry(entry: ProjectLogEntry): Promise<void>
  async checkConflicts(): Promise<Conflict[]>
  async executeWithLogging(): Promise<void>
}
```

## Parallel Execution Strategy

For maximum speed, run agents in parallel where possible:

```bash
# Sprint 1: Planning (Some Parallel)
claude> /agents spawn vision-challenger
claude> /agents spawn journal-keeper --watch &

# After vision completes
claude> /agents spawn prd-generator

# After PRD completes (parallel)
claude> /agents spawn architecture-designer &
claude> /agents spawn design-system-creator &

# After architecture completes
claude> /agents spawn stack-analyzer
claude> /agents spawn docs-fetcher  # After stack

# Sprint 2: Building (Parallel with guards)
claude> /agents spawn task-executor --phase 0 &
claude> /agents spawn task-executor --phase 1 &
claude> /agents spawn test-guardian --watch &
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

Create a simple monitoring view:

```typescript
// agents/monitor.ts
function showDashboard() {
  console.clear();
  console.log('🤖 AGENT STATUS DASHBOARD');
  console.log('═'.repeat(50));

  // Planning Agents
  console.log('\n📋 PLANNING');
  showAgent('vision-challenger', getStatus('vision-challenger'));
  showAgent('prd-generator', getStatus('prd-generator'));

  // Building Agents
  console.log('\n🔨 BUILDING');
  showAgent('task-executor-1', getTaskProgress(1));
  showAgent('task-executor-2', getTaskProgress(2));

  // Quality Agents
  console.log('\n✅ QUALITY');
  showAgent('test-guardian', getTestStatus());
