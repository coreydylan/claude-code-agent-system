# Repository Integration Examples
## Real-World Agent System Integration Scenarios

This document showcases how the `repo-onboarding-agent` and `folder-documenter` agent integrate with different types of repositories at various stages of development.

---

## Example 1: Next.js E-commerce Application (Production Stage)

### Repository Profile
```yaml
Repository: "shopify-competitor"
Type: Full-stack e-commerce platform
Primary Language: TypeScript
Framework: Next.js 14 with App Router
Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
Authentication: NextAuth.js
Payments: Stripe
Deployment: Vercel
Stage: Production (2 years old, 50k+ users)
Team Size: 8 developers
Git History: 2,847 commits
```

### Integration Process

#### Phase 1: Repository Analysis (repo-onboarding-agent)
```yaml
Discovery Results:
  File Structure:
    - app/ (App Router structure)
    - components/ (Shared UI components)
    - lib/ (Utility functions and configurations)
    - prisma/ (Database schema and migrations)
    - public/ (Static assets)
    - tests/ (Jest test suite)
  
  Detected Patterns:
    - Server Components with Client Components
    - Custom hooks for state management
    - Tailwind CSS with custom design system
    - API routes with middleware
    - Comprehensive error boundaries
  
  Build System:
    - npm scripts for dev/build/test
    - Custom lint rules with ESLint
    - Husky for git hooks
    - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  
  Quality Gates:
    - TypeScript strict mode
    - 85% test coverage requirement
    - Prisma migration checks
    - Bundle size analysis
```

#### Generated AGENT_COMPATIBILITY_MAP.md
```markdown
# Agent Compatibility Map - Shopify Competitor

## Repository Profile
- **Type**: Production E-commerce Platform
- **Architecture**: Next.js App Router with Server Components
- **Risk Level**: HIGH (production system with users)

## Agent Adaptations

### task-executor
- **Build Commands**: Use `npm run build` and `npm run test:coverage`
- **Database**: Always run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes
- **Deployment**: Use `npm run build && npm run start` for verification

### foundation-architect
- **Existing Architecture**: Preserve App Router structure
- **Extension Points**: Add new features in app/(feature)/ directories
- **Anti-Patterns**: Never modify existing API routes without tests

### Critical Preservation
- **Never Touch**: prisma/migrations/, .next/, node_modules/
- **Backup First**: prisma/schema.prisma, package.json
- **Team Approval**: Any changes to payment processing or auth
```

#### Integration Results
- **Setup Time**: 45 minutes (deep analysis of large codebase)
- **Files Created**: PROJECT_MANIFESTO.md, AGENT_COMPATIBILITY_MAP.md, complete TASKS/ structure
- **Risk Assessment**: High-risk integration requiring staged rollout
- **Next Steps**: Start with non-critical feature development

### Phase 2: Folder Documentation (folder-documenter)

When agents complete work in any folder, `folder-documenter` generates comprehensive documentation:

#### Example: `/app/dashboard/` folder documentation
```markdown
# Dashboard Folder Documentation
*Auto-generated by folder-documenter agent on 2025-08-07T14:30:00Z*

## Overview
### Purpose
Provides admin and user dashboard interfaces for e-commerce platform management.

### Architecture
```
app/dashboard/
├── page.tsx                 # Main dashboard landing page
├── analytics/              # Analytics and reporting section
│   ├── page.tsx            # Analytics dashboard
│   ├── components/         # Analytics-specific components
│   └── hooks/             # Data fetching hooks
├── orders/                # Order management section
├── products/              # Product management section
└── layout.tsx             # Shared dashboard layout
```

## Integration Points
- **Authentication**: Uses NextAuth session from layout
- **Database**: Prisma client for order/product queries
- **Payments**: Stripe webhook handling in orders section
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for order updates

## Error Handling & Kill Switches
### Error Boundaries
- `dashboard/error.tsx` catches all dashboard errors
- Graceful fallback to basic dashboard view

### Kill Switches
#### Emergency Disable (`/api/admin/kill-switch`)
- **Trigger**: Critical system failure in orders
- **Action**: Redirect all dashboard traffic to maintenance page
- **Recovery**: Manual re-enable via environment variable

## Development Guide
### Adding New Dashboard Sections
1. Create folder under `app/dashboard/[section]/`
2. Follow existing page.tsx and layout.tsx patterns
3. Add navigation item to `dashboard/components/nav.tsx`
4. Add tests in `tests/dashboard/[section]/`
```

## Example 2: Python FastAPI Microservice (MVP Stage)

### Repository Profile
```yaml
Repository: "user-auth-service"
Type: Backend microservice
Primary Language: Python 3.11
Framework: FastAPI with Pydantic
Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
Testing: pytest with fixtures
Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes
Stage: MVP (6 months old, beta users)
Team Size: 3 developers
```

### Integration Process

#### Phase 1: Analysis Results
```yaml
Discovery:
  Structure:
    - app/ (FastAPI application code)
    - tests/ (pytest test suite)
    - migrations/ (Alembic database migrations)
    - docker/ (Container configurations)
    - scripts/ (Utility scripts)
  
  Patterns:
    - Dependency injection with FastAPI
    - Repository pattern for data access
    - Pydantic models for validation
    - JWT token authentication
    - Async/await throughout

  Quality Gates:
    - pytest with 90% coverage
    - Black code formatting
    - mypy type checking
    - Alembic migration validation
```

#### Generated Compatibility Map (Key Sections)
```yaml
Agent Adaptations:
  task-executor:
    Build: "docker build -t auth-service ."
    Test: "pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing"
    Database: "alembic upgrade head"
    
  foundation-architect:
    Extension Points: "app/routers/ for new endpoints"
    Existing Patterns: "Follow repository pattern in app/repositories/"
    
Risk Assessment: MEDIUM
  - Beta stage allows for more experimentation
  - Database migrations require careful testing
  - Authentication changes need security review
```

### Phase 2: Generated Folder Documentation

#### Example: `/app/auth/` folder
```markdown
# Authentication Module Documentation

## Overview
Core authentication and authorization logic for the user service.

## Components
- `jwt_handler.py` - JWT token creation and validation
- `password.py` - Password hashing and verification  
- `dependencies.py` - FastAPI dependency injection
- `models.py` - Pydantic models for auth requests

## Error Handling
### Security Kill Switches
#### Rate Limit Breach (`auth/rate_limiter.py:45`)
- **Trigger**: >100 failed attempts in 5 minutes
- **Action**: Block IP for 24 hours
- **Recovery**: Admin can unblock via `/admin/unblock-ip`

#### Token Compromise Detection (`auth/jwt_handler.py:78`)
- **Trigger**: Same token used from >5 different IPs
- **Action**: Invalidate token, force re-authentication
- **Recovery**: User must log in again

## Integration with Other Services
- **User Service**: Validates user existence before token creation
- **Audit Service**: Logs all authentication events
- **Notification Service**: Alerts on suspicious activities
```

## Example 3: React Component Library (Early Stage)

### Repository Profile
```yaml
Repository: "design-system-lib"
Type: Component library
Primary Language: TypeScript
Framework: React 18 with Storybook
Build: Rollup with TypeScript
Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
Stage: Early development (2 months old)
Team Size: 2 developers
```

### Integration Results

#### Generated Manifesto (Key Principles)
```markdown
# Design System Library Manifesto

## Project-Specific Maxims
- "Components are contracts" - API stability is paramount
- "Accessibility first" - Every component WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- "Documentation is UX" - Storybook stories are user interfaces
- "Semantic versioning is sacred" - Breaking changes require major version
- "Performance by default" - Tree-shaking and bundle size matter

## Technical Principles
### Component Architecture
- Compound components over props explosion
- Render props for complex behaviors
- Forward refs for DOM access
- TypeScript props with JSDoc

### Testing Strategy
- Visual regression tests with Chromatic
- Unit tests for logic, integration tests for behavior
- Accessibility tests with jest-axe
- Performance tests for render time
```

#### Folder Documentation Example: `/src/components/Button/`
```markdown
# Button Component Documentation

## Component API
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost'
  size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  disabled?: boolean
  loading?: boolean
  children: ReactNode
  onClick?: (event: MouseEvent) => void
}
```

## Usage Examples
```tsx
// Basic usage
<Button variant="primary" size="md">
  Click me
</Button>

// Loading state
<Button variant="primary" loading>
  Submitting...
</Button>
```

## Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Space)
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Focus management with loading states
- Screen reader announcements

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when icons fail to load
- Fallback text for loading states
- Error boundaries prevent component tree crashes

## Kill Switches
#### Performance Circuit Breaker (`Button.tsx:67`)
- **Trigger**: Render time >16ms (60fps threshold)
- **Action**: Switch to simplified variant
- **Recovery**: Monitor performance, optimize on next render
```

## Example 4: Legacy Monolith Migration (Maintenance Stage)

### Repository Profile
```yaml
Repository: "enterprise-crm"
Type: Legacy monolith undergoing microservices migration
Primary Language: Java 11 with Spring Boot
Database: Oracle with Hibernate
Frontend: JSP with jQuery (being replaced by React)
Stage: Maintenance/Migration (5 years old)
Team Size: 15 developers
```

### Integration Challenges & Solutions

#### Special Considerations
```yaml
Risk Factors:
  - Legacy code with limited test coverage
  - Mixed architecture (monolith + microservices)
  - Active user base (no downtime allowed)
  - Complex deployment process
  - Regulatory compliance requirements

Agent Adaptations:
  - Read-only analysis mode initially
  - Gradual integration with extensive testing
  - Preservation of existing CI/CD pipelines
  - Compliance with enterprise security policies
```

#### Generated Compatibility Map Highlights
```markdown
## High-Risk Integration Protocol

### Phase 1: Read-Only Analysis (2 weeks)
- Map existing architecture completely
- Document all integration points
- Identify refactoring opportunities
- Zero code changes during analysis

### Phase 2: Isolated Feature Development (4 weeks)  
- New features only in designated "greenfield" areas
- Complete test coverage requirement (>95%)
- Security review for all changes
- Gradual rollout with feature flags

### Phase 3: Legacy Enhancement (Ongoing)
- Improve test coverage in existing code
- Gradual modernization of components
- Documentation of undocumented systems
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Preservation Requirements
- Never modify: legacy payment processing, user authentication
- Backup required: all configuration files, database schemas
- Team approval: any changes affecting >1000 users
```

#### Folder Documentation: `/src/main/java/com/company/payments/`
```markdown
# Legacy Payments Module Documentation
*Generated with special legacy analysis mode*

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SYSTEM WARNING ⚠️
This module handles financial transactions for 50,000+ active users.
ANY changes require:
1. Security team approval
2. Full regression test suite
3. Staged deployment with rollback plan
4. 24/7 monitoring during deployment

## Architecture (Legacy)
- Spring MVC controllers with JSP views
- Hibernate ORM with native SQL queries
- Synchronous processing (no async)
- File-based logging (no structured logs)

## Known Issues & Workarounds
- Memory leak in payment processor (restart required every 6 hours)
- Race condition in concurrent payments (mutex lock implemented)
- Oracle connection pool exhaustion (circuit breaker added)

## Migration Strategy
Phase 1: Extract to microservice (in progress)
Phase 2: Implement event-driven architecture
Phase 3: Replace with modern payment gateway
Timeline: 8-12 months
```

## Best Practices Learned

### For Repository Integration
1. **Start Read-Only**: Analyze first, modify later
2. **Respect Conventions**: Match existing patterns, don't impose new ones
3. **Gradual Integration**: Phase rollouts reduce risk
4. **Comprehensive Backup**: Always create restoration points
5. **Team Communication**: Over-communicate changes and plans

### For Folder Documentation
1. **Trigger Early**: Document as work completes, not after
2. **Include Context**: Cross-folder relationships are critical
3. **Error Scenarios**: Document failure modes and recovery
4. **Maintenance**: Keep documentation current with code changes
5. **Human-Readable**: Write for future team members, not just agents

### For Different Repository Types
- **Production Systems**: Maximum caution, staged rollouts, comprehensive testing
- **MVP/Beta**: Balanced risk, focus on enabling rapid development
- **Early Stage**: More experimentation allowed, establish good patterns
- **Legacy Systems**: Preservation first, enhancement second, migration planning

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Integration Failures
```yaml
Issue: Agent can't detect technology stack
Solution: Check for standard files (package.json, requirements.txt)
Fallback: Manual configuration in AGENT_COMPATIBILITY_MAP.md

Issue: Build commands fail during integration
Solution: Verify environment requirements, check dependency versions
Fallback: Use generic build patterns, document manual steps

Issue: Existing workflows disrupted
Solution: Rollback integration, analyze conflicts, gradual re-integration
Prevention: Always backup critical files before integration
```

### Documentation Quality Issues
```yaml
Issue: Generated documentation too technical
Solution: Configure folder-documenter for target audience
Enhancement: Add human review step for critical documentation

Issue: Documentation becomes outdated quickly
Solution: Implement automatic regeneration triggers
Best Practice: Integrate with CI/CD to update docs on code changes

Issue: Cross-folder relationships not captured
Solution: Enhanced analysis phase, dependency mapping
Future: Automated architecture diagrams from code analysis
```
