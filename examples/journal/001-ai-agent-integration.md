# AI Agent Integration - Hour 21

## The Task-Executor Agent

Just completed integrating Claude Code with our task system. Key details:

### Agent Creation

```
> claude
> /agents
  ⎿ Agent changes:
     Created agent: task-executor

> spawn task executor agents to work on tasks
```

### The Task-Executor Agent Capabilities

The `task-executor` agent can:

1. **Read task files** from `TASKS/` directory structure
2. **Parse task objectives, steps, and acceptance criteria**
3. **Execute documented commands** exactly as written
4. **Verify completion** using provided acceptance criteria
5. **Update task status** by renaming files (`[ ]` → `[~]` → `[x]`)
6. **Handle dependencies** by moving to next available task when blocked
7. **Work through phases** sequentially

### Integration with Task System

The agent perfectly integrates with our file-based task tracking:

- Reads `TASKS/PHASE-X-NAME/[ ] task-name.md` files
- Follows documented steps precisely
- Checks acceptance criteria before marking complete
- Renames to `[x] task-name.md` when done
- Reports blockers and progress

### Human-AI Collaboration Model

- **Human**: Architecture, strategy, quality gates
- **task-executor agent**: Implementation following documentation
- **Human**: Verification at phase boundaries

### The Revolution

This transforms our 21-day manual build into an AI-automated execution engine. The agent can work through Phase 0-6 tasks while humans focus on verification and guidance.

**Status**: `task-executor` agent is now processing Phase 0 tasks from the TASKS/ folder.
